This repository contains the code for the paper Data-Driven Decision Making for Enhancing Small-Signal Stability in Hybrid AC/DC Grids Through Converter Control Role Assignment[1]. The

Hybrid AC/DC Transmission Grids integrate High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links through Interconnecting Power Converters (IPCs). The control role assigned to each IPC plays a key role in shaping grid dynamics. While traditional IPCs operate with fixed control roles, recent research has explored day-ahead scheduling of these roles to improve system stability. However, in power systems with high renewable energy penetration, forecast inaccuracies can make pre-scheduled control assignments suboptimal‚Äîor even destabilizing.

To overcome this limitation, this work introduces an online scheduling recalculation algorithm that dynamically updates IPC control roles during real-time operation. The algorithm is based on a data-driven, multi-criteria decision-making framework that incorporates surrogate models of conventional small-signal stability analysis tools. This allows for a rapid evaluation of system stability and performance metrics.

The proposed methodology is demonstrated on the test system shown in the Figure below [2].
This repository contains all the necessary code to implement and reproduce the methodology for this case study.

### üìÅ Repository Structure

#### `CCRCs_clustering/`

Contains all scripts required to perform **clustering of the Converter Control Role Configurations (CCRCs)** based on their dynamic behavior with respect to each stability performance indicator.
The methodology identifies groups of CCRCs exhibiting similar stability characteristics, and then applies a **set intersection technique** to determine the optimal subset of CCRCs. This subset ensures robust dynamic performance across the entire operating space according to multiple stability indicators.

#### `Datasets/`
Collects:
* The full dataset of exact small-signal stability assessment results computed for all CCRCs

* Scripts for data cleaning and feature engineering, including:

  * Conversion to per-unit (p.u.) values

  * Creation of additional features

  * Removal of highly correlated variables
  *  Reusable data cleaning functions to be applied to new datasets before training or testing the models

#### `Training_stability_assessment/`

Includes the code for training **data-driven surrogate models** that approximate the exact small-signal stability assessment.
The training workflow comprises:

* Apply data cleaning and feature engineering
* Initial model screening
* Feature selection using **permutation feature importance**
* Hyperparameter tuning via **grid search with k-fold cross-validation**
* Final model training

#### `Training_indicators_regression/`

Contains the scripts to train surrogate models that estimate the **quantitative values of small-signal stability performance indicators**.
The training pipeline follows a similar structure:

* Apply data cleaning and feature engineering
* Initial model screening
* Feature selection using **permutation feature importance**
* Final model training

**Note:** Running the full workflow may produce results that differ from those reported in the paper due to the inherent randomness in the models used (e.g., clustering, classifiers, regressors, permutation feature importance). To facilitate reproducibility, the models trained in the paper with the selected features are provided with the suffix `_paper`.

To reproduce the exact results from the paper when running the data-driven decision-making algorithm, set the parameter `reproduce_paper=True`.
